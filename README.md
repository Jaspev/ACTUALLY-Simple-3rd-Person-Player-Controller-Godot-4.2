This is a 3rd person player controller for Godot 4.2 that uses 2 scripts:
One script for camera movement and one script for player movement. No sprint, no jump, no animations,
nothing other than simple 3rd person camera movement, lateral player movement, and gravity.

This 3rd person player controller works like the Dark Souls and Mario 64 camera, in the way that the
player's model does not rotate with the camera, only when there is character movement. Every other
3rd person player controller I could find either copies the camera rotation directly onto the player
model constantly, which feels and looks really bad, or was just *incredibly* complicated for beginner
programmers like me and would multiple days, if not weeks to fully understand.
